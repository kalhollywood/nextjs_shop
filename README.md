# E-commerce project

This project is a work in progress and the latest version is deployed [here](www.). It is based on the teachings from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mOkFXyxfsU&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery). I chose this project as an opportunity to learn about and use NextJS, Stripe and Sanity.

## Key Learnings

- Sanity can be used to create a backend database and content management system and you can set up the schema as a JS object.
